# Naive-Bayes

To Implement a Naive Bayes classifier and to evaluate it on the available
data. The code should take as input a training and testing file. It will use the former to construct a Naive
Bayes classifier that predicts the class variable from the features with a cutoff of >= 0.5. It will then evaluate
this model using the training dataset and calculate a confusion matrix.

# Script
The python script NaiveBayes.py is the code that implements multiclass and binary classification. Two datasets where it is tried and tested has been incorporated

# Question
The Naive Bayes algorithm is implemented to calculate the probabilty for multiple classes. This can be implemented in the followin way python NaiveBayes.py TRAIN TEST MODEL-FILE RESULT-FILE
